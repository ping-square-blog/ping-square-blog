### Can AI generate Knowledge?

>“Data is not information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not understanding, understanding is not wisdom.”
>
>— _Clifford Stoll_

let us Embark on a journey through the fascinating spiral of cognitive development, where simple **data** (facts) blossoms into rich **information** (organized data) which then matures into deep **knowledge** (information insight/patterns). Enough knowledge will then evolve into profound **understanding**(implications of the knowledge). As understanding deepens, it transforms into **wisdom**(predictions and decision making), guiding us to reshape and refine the very data we began with. This elegant dance of growth and insight ensures that every cycle enhances our grasp of the world, making us not just observers, but wise participants in the tapestry of knowledge, so now does AI.

Consider the example of using social media to understand how AI can impact the transformation from data to wisdom and how Wisdom will go back to reshape the data:

- The process begins with **data collection**: Imagine you're browsing Instagram and every photo, video, comment, and like represents raw details. This includes numbers of likes, the content of comments, and timestamps of posts.
- When you group/process this data into meaningful categories, it becomes **information**. For instance, noticing that posts tagged with #summerfun get more likes on sunny days, or that videos tend to gather more engagement than photos.
- **Knowledge** comes from interpreting this information over time to identify patterns or trends. AI systems might use this stage to apply learning algorithms to predict that posts made in the afternoon receive more engagement, or that certain hashtags lead to increased visibility with your followers.
- **Understanding** is achieved when the AI synthesizes knowledge to grasp deeper insights such as why these patterns occur. Maybe afternoon posts hit when most people check their phones, or specific hashtags resonate more because they are linked to popular events or moods among your audience.
- **Wisdom** in AI might be demonstrated by the system's ability  to make informed decisions. For instance, planning your posts to maximize engagement, using insights to drive meaningful interactions, or even advising friends on the best times to post based on your findings.
- **Consolidation** happens when this wisdom influences how you perceive and use data. You might begin focusing more on the quality of comments rather than quantity, or prioritizing content that fosters genuine interactions over mere likes. This refined approach influences how you gather and value new data, enhancing the cycle.

### Can AI turn knowledge into a commodity?

According to recent estimates, the world generates approximately **402.74 million terabytes** of data every day. To put that in perspective, that is equivalent to over **9 million years** of video content every 24 hours! Of course data, by its mere abundance has become a commodity but does that mean knoledge too? or the real question should be how much data constitute a unit of knowledge?

in today's digital economy where data is increasingly treated as a commodity, there is litle doubt that knowledge, as a byproduct,  will know the same faith. But given the umoungous volume of data, what better tool than AI to guaranti the transformation of raw facts into actionable knowledge? Before you start thinking otherwise, here is how I Think AI is already turning Knowledge into a commodity.

1. **Democratization of Information**: AIs, due to their ability to generate, summarize, and interpret large amounts of text, have made it easier for people to access and understand complex information. Previously, deep knowledge on many subjects might have been confined to experts or to those with the time and resources to study extensively. Now, AIs can provide high-level explanations or deep dives into a wide range of topics quickly and efficiently.
2. **Standardization of Knowledge**: Much like a commodity, which is standardized and interchangeable, AIs provide information that tends to standardize knowledge. When you ask different AIs a question, assuming they've been trained on similar datasets, their responses are likely to be broadly consistent, reflecting a kind of uniformity in the information they provide.
3. **Valuation of Information**: As information becomes more accessible and standardized, its value can change. In some respects, the ease of access to information via AIs could decrease the perceived value of certain types of knowledge that were previously harder to acquire. Conversely, the ability to leverage AIs to synthesize and apply this information creatively and effectively in new contexts may become more valuable.
4. **Ubiquity and Accessibility**: Information that once required specialized training or significant effort to understand and use is now more readily available to a general audience. This ubiquity shifts the way knowledge is consumed and applied across different sectors of society and industry.
In this information economy, How much information constitutes a unit of knowledge? How much knowledge is enough knowledge to turn you into a power?

### How much knowledge is good knowledge?

>“As a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information.”
>
>— _Benjamin Disraeli_

How much knowledge is needed to achieve wisdom? In the vast landscape of cognition, data stands as the solitary quantifiable element. Traditionally, the true merit of knowledge is often only revealed over time. This raises a thought-provoking question: Is the real strength of knowledge gauged by its depth and quality, or simply by its volume? We often assume that amassing more data will inherently refine our knowledge, suggesting a preference for quantity. Yet, our traditions, our culture, our religions, our whole system of beliefs is based on selective knowledge passed on from generation to generation. in a Profit-driven society, the quality of knowledge is determined by its financial impact. Maybe we should get ready for a world where everything will be reduce to its monetary value, that is if we are not there yet.

### What if knowledge become a commodity?

> "knowledge is power"

>— _Francis Bacon_

A world with knowledge as a commodity will certainly be an uptopia! Anyone will command enough power to change the world! But will they? The real question is: "does everyone has the right mind to wild that power?".

In 1960, in the era of space exploration, Isaac Asimov was full of hope when he said that: "The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. But our ventures into space may change that". Can we say for sure that our venture into Artificial Intelligence will increase our wisdom? I suspect that Isaac Asimov would be less optimistic if he was to learn that in 2019, the USA created another branch of the military, namely the U.S space force.
